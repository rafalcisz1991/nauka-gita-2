                    We do walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>
                    And in spring too I feel no different.<br>
                    We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>
                    through much dark-red loss, <span>appellation controlée,</span><br>
                </br />
                    that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br>
                    We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>
                    Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br>
                    sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br>
                </br />
                    33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br>
                    of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>
                    at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br>
                </br />
                    Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>
                    The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>
                    The here is nowhere, and the now is never.<br>
